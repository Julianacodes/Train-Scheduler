# Train-Scheduler

## Overview
I created a train schedule application that uses Firebase to host arrival and departure data. My app retrieves and manipulates the data with Moment.js. This website provides up-to-date information about various trains that users input. It will provide the trains arrival times and how many minutes remain until the trains arrive at their station.
